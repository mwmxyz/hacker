## Course Description

![Electronic Literature by an Electronic Artist](eliteartist.png)

*"Electronic Literature by an Electronic Artist" generated by Anne Sullivan using Disco Diffusion*

In this seminar, we will explore contemporary forms of "playable" texts and technology, which broadly encompasses many genres of electronic literature, hypertexts, games, literary fiction and poetry created using the affordances of the computer and networked media. Working from the prehistory of Oulipian constrained writing through to early hypertext experiments of Shelley Jackson to contemporary interactive fiction and games such as Kentucky Route Zero and Disco Elysium, we will develop an understanding of both the history and current trends in born-digital literary experimentation and practice. Through the lens of these digital texts, we will explore the potential for reimagining the "book" through new interfaces, interactions, and technologies. While we will engage in literary readings of code and design choices in interactive and procedural work, no knowledge of code is necessary. Genres under examination include:

- Hypertext fiction
- Electronic Poetry
- Interactive Fiction
- Generative Works and Bots
- Literary Games
- Installations and Kinetic Text
- Augmented and Virtual Reality
- Adventure and Narrative Games

While students are welcome to purchase the individual books, all course texts will be available for free through e-library reserves at UCF or as open access texts. Assignments include weekly discussions; close readings; code and design critique; and an iterative conference-length research paper. Venues recommended for the paper include graduate-student friendly journals such as [*Hyperrhiz*](http://hyperrhiz.io/cfp.html), [*Game Studies*](https://gamestudies.org/2301), or [*Electronic Book Review*](http://electronicbookreview.com/policies-and-submissions/). Alternatively, students are encouraged to consider preparing submissions to relevant conferences (CFPs will be posted throughout the course).

Each week, plan on following following instructions in online modules regarding readings and online exercises. Each module will be divided into three sections:

- **Weekly readings.** Complete this combination of primary and secondary texts prior to engaging with the rest of the module. The full schedule of required readings is listed in the syllabus: additional recommended readings will be provided in each module.
- **Analysis.** A combination of prerecorded lectures, recommended readings and viewings, and annotations from the instructor for reflection. Some weeks feature additional guest speakers and additional recommended readings to accompany their conversations.
- **Discussion.** A weekly discussion will focus on progress towards the course paper, with opportunities to share and reflect upon the works with your peers. Discussions are required, and will be graded on completion.

---

## Course Objectives

- Develop an understanding of electronic literature as a form, including the terminology and theoretical frameworks necessary to discuss born-digital works
- Explore the connections between electronic literature and traditional text, including experimental and Oulipian influences
- Understand the role of code and procedural (or rules-based) systems in transforming potential approaches to literature
- Analyze the intersection and influence of electronic literature on mainstream genres, such as literary games and walking simulators
- Critique emerging and experimental born-digital works in the context of changing platforms and technologies impacting their creation, distribution, and reception
- Understand current debates and concepts from game studies through a range of critical and theoretical lenses

---

## Materials and Texts

Our primary books are available through the library course reserves or as open access books:

- Hayles, N. Katherine. *Electronic Literature: New Horizons for the Literary.* [Via UCF Library](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucf/detail.action?docID=3441028)
- Ensslin, Astrid. *Literary Gaming.* [Via UCF Library](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucf/detail.action?docID=3339803)
- Chang, Alenda. *Playing Nature: Ecology in Video Games.* [Via UCF Library](
https://muse-jhu-edu.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/book/72358)
- Gray, Kishonna L. *Intersectional Tech: Black Users in Digital Gaming.* [Via UCF Library](https://muse-jhu-edu.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/book/77262)

Supplementary recommended readings are included in each module to guide work towards the final research paper, while providing additional entry points into each form and genre under examination. We will typically look at one to two primary texts a week alongside supplemental secondary readings, though this may vary depending on the length of primary texts.

## Evaluation and Grading

| Points  | Assignment Summary | Due Date  |
|---|---|---|
| 5  | **Activity Verification** - Complete the brief survey posted on Webcourses as soon as possible to confirm your enrollment in the course. As this is required by the university, please attend to it as soon as possible at the start of classes. | Friday, August 25th  |
| 45  | **Discussions** - Ten weekly discussions will consist of sharing preliminary readings and arguments, as well as progress towards the final paper. Students are encouraged to use screenshots from the works under discussion. There will be no required discussions on weeks with large project deadlines: each discussion is worth 5 points, and the lowest discussion grade will be dropped, allowing for one missed week. | Weekly |
| 10 | **Traversal** - Using the methodology of the *Pathfinders* project, record a short (generally 4-5 minute) traversal critiquing a selected playable text. The selected work will ideally be one of the pieces the student has chosen to analyze for their research paper. | Sunday, September 24th  |
| 10  |  **Literature Review** - Following the selection of a playable text or texts for the final project, students will develop a literature review to become familiar with the discussion of the work and its genre. Plan to gather at least five additional scholarly sources, and two blogs or reviews, to complete a literature review for the final analysis paper. Students are encouraged to use Zotero to manage their works cited efficiently. | Sunday, October 29th  |
| 20  |  **Paper or Webtext Draft** - An approximately 4,000 word draft of a final paper or webtext analyzing a playable text or set of texts, chosen in consulation with the professor, and building from the annotation and literature review. Students should follow the formatting guidelines of their chosen venue, including citation requirements. | Sunday, November 20th  |
| 10 |  **Final Revision Memo** - Provide a plan for a substantial article or webtext revision, responsive to the feedback recieved on the draft submission. This memo should be professionally structured and addressed to the editor of your target journal. | Friday, December 8th  |

Students can access their grades and feedback at any time using the Grade Book function of Webcourses. All assignments will be submitted through Webcourses. Plan on checking the site at least twice a week for updates and assignment information. Grades are calculated out of 100 following a standard letter scale.

Late work is accepted without penalty through one week after the assignment deadline. If circumstances require extension beyond that deadline, please reach out to the instructor immediately. As assignments throughout the course are designed to build on the previous exercise, assignments must be completed in sequence.

There is no extra credit work available in this class, but one discussion grade will be forgiven to allow for a missed week of participation. Grades will be available through Webcourses and updated weekly.

---

## Asynchronous Course Structure

This course uses an asynchronous format, and relies upon students to complete all readings, engage with both pre-recorded and external videos, and join in on course discussions. All assignments are due on Sunday night at the close of their listed module, but will be accepted with no penalty through the Sunday after the deadline. Once an assignment closes, late work will not be accepted unless an additional extension has already been approved by the instructor: please reach out early if circumstances will require additional time!

- Office hour assistance is available both through text on Webcourses messages and via Zoom: reaching out through Webcourses first is recommended, and Zoom meetings will be scheduled at mutually convenient times.
- All course materials are asynchronous, using a mix of video and text as appropriate. However, the course does require consistent weekly participation following the listed schedule - it is not self-paced!
- Students will need access to a reliable internet connection and computer, chromebook, or tablet in order to participate in the course. Students are not required to install software, but will have the option to do so for some critiques.
- In the event of an emergency or medical challenge, additional flexibility beyond the grading guidelines is available: when anticipated, students should reach out to the instructor as soon as feasible to form a plan or discuss an incomplete if needed. Note that incompletes will not be awarded with more than two missing assignments, and must be completed within six months of the close of class.

## General Policies

### Academic Integrity

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/) defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.

**UCF Creed:** Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.

1. Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2. Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3. Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4. Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5. Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should familiarize themselves with [UCF's Rules of Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

### Course Accessibility Statement

This course is built with universal design for learning principles in mind: if you encounter challenges with any of the course materials, assignments, platforms, or requirements, please reach out for assistance, and know that additional support is always available regardles of documentation. If changes in course modality occur and you require additional accomodations, please reach out as soon as possible.

Additionally, the University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the [online version](http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html).
- Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see [locations](https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations).
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to [MyUCF](https://my.ucf.edu) and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.
- To learn about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus or elsewhere, consider viewing this [video](https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk).

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

### Authorized Events and Religious Observances

Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied.

Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the [UCF policy](http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf). No penalty will be applied.

### Title IX Policy

Title IX prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and retaliation. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find resources available to support the victim, including confidential resources and information concerning reporting options at [Let's be Clear](https://letsbeclear.ucf.edu) and [SDES](http://cares.sdes.ucf.edu/).
